# Welcome to Hyperstack!


Welcome to _Hyperstack_, the full stack web framework for the _pragmatic developer_. Hyperstack is [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) inspired, but what you should take from that, is that it gives you everything you need as a solo developer to build great products.

:::info Build your app, but bring your own frontend
_Hyperstack_ focuses on building great apps, modeling data, logic and common tasks, and leaves frontend choices to you. There are great frontend frameworks, so we didn't reinvent the wheel.
:::

You should use _Hyperstack_ if you:

* Have a great idea and want to build stuff, ship it fast and iterate quickly
* Have no time or desire to map the concept of "building stuff" to Kubernetes, or breaking it apart to microservices, lambdas, serverless functions, or other very specific technologies
* Like the idea of plain old databases, models, logic, and test-driven products, no surprises here
