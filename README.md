# Getting started

```
pnpm create hyperstack
```

And then

```
cd my-hyperstack-app
pnpm install && pnpm run dev
```

That's it, you can `curl` your app:


```
curl http://localhost:5150/
```

And then, continue to the README.md in your newly generated app.

## What's with the EVH references?

_Hyperstack_ is loaded with Van Halen references.

Eddie Van Halen was a great musician and guitar soloist, but also a [great engineer with a hacker mentality](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a15615/how-eddie-van-halen-hacks-a-guitar/). 


So Hyperstack is for people who like to hack things and go solo. Get it?
